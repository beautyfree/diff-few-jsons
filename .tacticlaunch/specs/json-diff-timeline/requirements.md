# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the initial requirements for a Next.js web service that allows users to ingest any number of JSON objects and visualize the differences between each pair over time. The application will feature a beautiful, modern UI inspired by contemporary product design references (e.g., Dribbble, Mobbin) and will use Framer Motion for interactions and micro-animations. The core goals are accuracy of the diff engine (including nested objects and arrays), an intuitive timeline-based comparison experience, responsive performance for medium-to-large JSON payloads, and a delightful, accessible interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1 — Multi-JSON Ingestion

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to add multiple JSON objects (from paste, files, or URLs), so that I can compare them comprehensively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides multiple JSON inputs via paste THEN the system SHALL accept and queue each as a distinct version.
2. WHEN a user uploads one or more `.json` files THEN the system SHALL parse each file as a distinct version.
3. WHEN a user supplies URLs pointing to JSON THEN the system SHALL fetch and parse each URL as a distinct version, surfacing fetch errors per URL.
4. IF a provided input is not valid JSON THEN the system SHALL display a clear validation error and SHALL not add it to the set.
5. IF two inputs are byte-identical THEN the system SHALL deduplicate or clearly label duplicates to avoid redundant comparisons.

### Requirement 2 — Version Metadata and Time Ordering

**User Story:** As a product analyst, I want each JSON input to have timestamp and label metadata, so that I can order and recognize versions over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an input is added THEN the system SHALL allow editing of its label and timestamp.
2. IF an input lacks a timestamp THEN the system SHALL assign an acquisition time and allow manual re-ordering.
3. WHEN versions are reordered THEN the system SHALL re-compute adjacency-based comparisons as needed.
4. WHEN two or more versions have identical timestamps THEN the system SHALL preserve a stable secondary order (e.g., insertion order).

### Requirement 3 — Pairwise Diff Computation (All Pairs and Adjacent Over Time)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to compute diffs for every pair of versions and for adjacent versions along a timeline, so that I can inspect changes comprehensively or stepwise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN N versions are present THEN the system SHALL support computing all pairwise diffs (N×(N−1)/2) on-demand.
2. WHEN a timeline order is established THEN the system SHALL compute diffs between adjacent versions by default.
3. IF the number of versions exceeds a configurable threshold THEN the system SHALL lazily compute non-adjacent diffs upon selection.
4. WHILE diffs are computing THEN the system SHALL show a progress indicator without blocking the UI.

### Requirement 4 — Diff Semantics (Objects, Arrays, Primitives)

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want accurate and explainable diffs across nested structures and arrays, so that I can trust what changed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing objects THEN the system SHALL identify additions, deletions, and modifications by key path.
2. WHEN comparing primitives THEN the system SHALL display before/after values with clear highlighting.
3. WHEN comparing arrays THEN the system SHALL support at least two strategies: index-based comparison and key-based matching (by configured key/path).
4. IF array matching strategy is ambiguous or unspecified THEN the system SHALL default to index-based and indicate the strategy in the UI.
5. WHEN encountering large arrays (>1,000 items) THEN the system SHALL virtualize rendering and paginate or chunk computation.

### Requirement 5 — Timeline Visualization and Scrubbing

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want a timeline scrubber to step or play through versions, so that I can see changes evolve over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple versions exist THEN the system SHALL render a horizontal timeline with labeled stops.
2. WHEN the user scrubs or plays the timeline THEN the system SHALL transition diffs between adjacent versions with smooth animations (Framer Motion).
3. WHEN a specific pair (A,B) is selected from a matrix THEN the system SHALL sync the timeline to highlight A and B.
4. IF a version is deleted from the set THEN the system SHALL update the timeline and any active comparisons without errors.

### Requirement 6 — Diff Visualization UI

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clear visual diff with color-coded highlights, collapsing, and search, so that I can focus on relevant changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a diff is shown THEN the system SHALL present a tree view with expandable nodes for nested structures.
2. WHEN a node is expanded THEN the system SHALL lazy-render child diffs to maintain performance.
3. WHEN the user searches by key or value THEN the system SHALL filter and highlight matching diff nodes.
4. WHEN changes are additions/deletions/modifications THEN the system SHALL use consistent color semantics and a legend.
5. IF a node has no changes (unchanged) THEN the system SHALL provide a toggle to hide unchanged nodes globally.

### Requirement 7 — Ignore and Transform Rules

**User Story:** As a backend engineer, I want to ignore or normalize certain fields, so that noise (e.g., timestamps, IDs) does not distract from meaningful changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user defines ignore rules (by key path, glob, or regex) THEN the system SHALL exclude those fields from diffs.
2. WHEN the user defines transforms (e.g., rounding numbers, normalizing case, sorting arrays) THEN the system SHALL apply transforms prior to diff.
3. IF ignore/transform rules produce invalid JSON THEN the system SHALL surface a clear error and skip applying the faulty rule.
4. WHEN rules are active THEN the system SHALL visibly indicate active rules and allow one-click disable per rule.

### Requirement 8 — Input Size, Performance, and Resource Constraints

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want the app to handle moderately large JSONs quickly, so that it remains usable on real-world data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN total input size is up to 25 MB and any single JSON up to 10 MB THEN the system SHALL remain responsive, with initial parse in <2s and first diff in <3s on a typical laptop.
2. WHEN computing diffs for large structures THEN the system SHALL perform computation off the main thread (Web Worker) where available.
3. WHEN rendering large trees THEN the system SHALL use virtualization to keep frame rates above 50 FPS.
4. WHEN memory pressure is detected THEN the system SHALL throttle background diff computations and prioritize active views.

### Requirement 9 — Modern Aesthetic and Motion (Framer Motion)

**User Story:** As a designer, I want a modern, polished interface with tasteful motion, so that the tool feels delightful and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between screens or states THEN the system SHALL use Framer Motion for transitions and micro-interactions.
2. WHEN hovering, expanding, or selecting UI elements THEN the system SHALL animate state changes within 200–300ms using spring/ease curves.
3. WHEN theming is toggled between light and dark THEN the system SHALL animate color transitions without flashing.
4. WHERE design references are used THEN the system SHALL document at least three specific inspirational references (Dribbble shots or Mobbin flows) within the design notes.

### Requirement 10 — Input Methods and Session Management

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to save and restore my comparison sessions, so that I can share or revisit my analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user chooses to save a session THEN the system SHALL persist versions, labels, order, and rules to local storage.
2. WHEN a user downloads a session THEN the system SHALL export a portable `.json` session file.
3. WHEN a user imports a session file THEN the system SHALL restore all versions, rules, and UI state.
4. IF local storage is unavailable THEN the system SHALL allow download-only persistence.

### Requirement 11 — Accessibility and Keyboard Navigation

**User Story:** As an accessibility-minded user, I want the app to be usable with screen readers and the keyboard, so that it is inclusive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the app with a keyboard THEN the system SHALL support focus outlines, skip links, and key bindings for expand/collapse/search.
2. WHEN using a screen reader THEN the system SHALL expose semantic roles, labels, and live region updates for diff results.
3. WHERE color is used to convey meaning THEN the system SHALL also provide non-color cues (icons, labels).
4. WHEN tested against WCAG 2.1 AA THEN the system SHALL meet criteria for color contrast and interaction.

### Requirement 12 — API and Architecture Boundaries

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear separation between diff engine logic and UI, so that I can test and reuse the engine.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the diff engine is used THEN the system SHALL expose a pure function (e.g., `computeJsonDiff(a,b,options)`) with deterministic output.
2. WHEN running in Next.js THEN the system SHALL provide an `/api/diff` endpoint for optional server-side computation for very large payloads.
3. IF server-side computation is used THEN the system SHALL stream results or chunk responses to avoid timeouts.
4. WHEN engine options change (array strategy, ignore rules) THEN the system SHALL recompute diffs and emit structured results with stable schemas.

### Requirement 13 — Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my data to remain local by default, so that sensitive information is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the app by default THEN the system SHALL process JSON locally in the browser and SHALL not send data to external services.
2. IF the user explicitly enables server-side diffing THEN the system SHALL clearly warn about data transmission and SHALL use HTTPS.
3. WHEN remote URLs are fetched THEN the system SHALL validate CORS and restrict redirects; errors SHALL be surfaced to the user.
4. WHEN running in production THEN the system SHALL use a CSP that restricts script sources and disallows inline scripts except for hashes as needed.

### Requirement 14 — Internationalization and Copy

**User Story:** As a global audience, I want clear English copy and room for future localization, so that the tool is understandable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering UI text THEN the system SHALL provide English copy by default.
2. WHEN the app is architected THEN the system SHALL isolate copy in a message catalog to enable future i18n.
3. IF a translation is missing THEN the system SHALL fall back to English without breaking layout.

### Requirement 15 — Quality, Testing, and Telemetry

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want confidence in correctness and insights into performance, so that the app stays reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the diff engine is updated THEN the system SHALL run unit tests covering objects, arrays, primitives, and rule combinations.
2. WHEN the UI is built THEN the system SHALL include component tests for critical flows (ingest, compare, timeline scrub, search, export).
3. WHEN performance degrades beyond thresholds THEN the system SHALL surface metrics (compute time, render time) in a developer panel.
4. WHERE telemetry is collected THEN the system SHALL avoid PII and SHALL be opt-in.

### Requirement 16 — Technology and Delivery Constraints

**User Story:** As a lead engineer, I want clear tech constraints, so that the implementation remains consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the app THEN the system SHALL use Next.js (App Router) with TypeScript.
2. WHEN implementing motion THEN the system SHALL use `framer-motion` for animations.
3. WHEN styling the app THEN the system SHALL use a modern, utility-first or component-driven approach (e.g., Tailwind CSS or styled system), documented in the design notes.
4. WHEN running locally THEN the system SHALL support Node.js 18+ and modern browsers (last two versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

---

Suggested areas for clarification in the next iteration:

- Array diffing defaults for common data shapes (e.g., matching by `id`, `name`, or custom key).
- Maximum expected number of versions per session and target performance tiers beyond the baseline.
- Specific visual design references (links to Dribbble shots or Mobbin flows) to lock in the look and feel.
- Whether collaboration/sharing beyond local export/import is in scope for v1.
- Any compliance constraints (e.g., handling of sensitive data, enterprise deployment).
